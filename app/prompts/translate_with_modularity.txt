You are an expert developer.
    Using the following modular design and COBOL code, generate a modern, modular {target_lang} code file.
    Modular Design:
    {modular_design}

    - Once you have generated all the codes. Once again write a complete code and put your final code in {target_lang} in between <Final Code> </Final Code> xml tags.
    COBOL CODE:
    {cobol_code}
