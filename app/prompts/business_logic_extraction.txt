You are a software architect.
Analyze the following COBOL program and extract its business logic in plain English.
Then, suggest a modular design for rewriting this program in a modern language (such as Python, C#, or Java).
The modular design should include:
- Main modules/classes/functions
- Their responsibilities
- How they interact (call relationships)
Present the modular design as a list and as a simple diagram (ASCII or Mermaid).
